Across Canada, Indigenous communities are embracing drone technology as a practical tool for protecting lands and waters. With vast territories to monitor, from old-growth forests to salmon-bearing rivers, the challenge has always been speed, cost, and access to timely information. Aboriginal Training Services (ATS) bridges that gap by delivering specialized drone training programs that blend Transport Canada certification standards with Indigenous knowledge and stewardship priorities.

To date, ATS has worked with more than 50 communities, training over 500 participants in drone operations, mapping, and data analysis. These trainees have completed more than 1,000 supervised flights, producing aerial imagery and monitoring data that covers large portions of Alberta and British Columbia. The results are tangible: communities now detect environmental changes faster, reduce dependence on costly external contractors, and strengthen sovereignty over how data is collected and used.

The success rate of these programs is equally compelling. Ninety-nine percent of students pass their Transport Canada examinations on the first attempt, demonstrating both the quality of instruction and the dedication of participants. Graduates leave not only with certificates but also with the confidence to lead local monitoring efforts, apply drone skills to conservation and resource management, and inspire youth to see future careers in science and technology.

## Drones provide real-time aerial perspectives of forest health

Indigenous Nations are responsible for stewarding some of the largest and most ecologically diverse territories in Canada. These lands and waters face mounting pressures: illegal logging, wildfire risk, climate-driven flooding, riverbank erosion, industrial development, and the need to protect wildlife habitats. Traditional monitoring methods—helicopter flights, consultant reports, or occasional government surveys—often arrive late, cost too much, or lack the depth of local knowledge required to understand change on the ground.

Communities increasingly require real-time, locally controlled environmental intelligence to safeguard forests, track water quality, assess post-fire regeneration, monitor cultural heritage sites, and respond to emerging threats. Drone technology provides a solution that is not only affordable and precise but also adaptable to seasonal cycles and community-driven priorities.

Aboriginal Training Services (ATS) builds programs with one clear vision: to make Indigenous communities **keepers of the land, keepers of the data, and keepers of the environment**. Each training initiative aims to:

- Build local drone pilot capacity so monitoring is community-led.  
- Support Indigenous data sovereignty, ensuring data ownership stays with the Nation.  
- Reduce dependency on outside contractors and costly aerial services.  
- Create career pathways for youth and professionals in conservation, forestry, resource management, and technology.  
- Blend cultural protocols with cutting-edge aerospace practices so monitoring respects both ancestral knowledge and modern standards.

By combining these objectives, ATS ensures that every flight not only produces high-quality imagery but also strengthens the autonomy and resilience of the communities it serves.

## Local community members prepare for drone flight training

Before adopting drone technology, Indigenous communities faced serious challenges in monitoring their lands and waters. Environmental change often went undetected until it was too late to respond effectively. Chartered helicopter and plane flights were prohibitively expensive, sometimes costing tens of thousands of dollars for a single survey. Because flights could only be arranged a few times per year, important seasonal changes—such as flood events, wildlife migration, or forest disease outbreaks—were often missed.

Communities also relied heavily on outside consultants and contractors who would arrive, collect data, and leave without building local skills or returning meaningful knowledge. Reports were often delayed by months and rarely reflected cultural protocols or community priorities. This dependence limited self-determination and forced Nations to make decisions with incomplete or outdated information.

Even when data was available, ownership and access remained a challenge. Imagery and analysis were sometimes stored with third parties, creating barriers to long-term comparisons and raising questions of sovereignty. On-the-ground monitoring teams faced risks from harsh weather, wildfire smoke, remote terrain, and wildlife encounters, making fieldwork dangerous and difficult.

Without modern, accessible monitoring tools, Indigenous leaders were left with high costs, limited data, and few opportunities to create sustainable local employment in environmental management.

## Traditional monitoring methods were costly and limited

Aboriginal Training Services (ATS) responds to these challenges with a comprehensive training program designed specifically for Indigenous communities. The program combines Transport Canada–aligned certification, hands-on flight practice, and community-centered monitoring applications. Rather than importing expertise, ATS builds it from within, ensuring that every participant leaves with the confidence and credentials to lead environmental monitoring efforts at home.

The curriculum is modular and adaptable. Participants begin with the fundamentals of drone operations, including safety protocols, airspace awareness, flight planning, and emergency procedures. Training then expands into environmental applications: conducting aerial surveys of forests, mapping rivers and floodplains, assessing wildfire recovery zones, and documenting cultural heritage sites. By pairing modern aerospace knowledge with Indigenous stewardship values, ATS ensures that technology strengthens rather than replaces traditional ways of caring for the land.

Equally important, ATS prioritizes data sovereignty. Trainees learn not only how to capture imagery but also how to manage, archive, and analyze it under community-defined protocols. This keeps control of sensitive environmental data in the hands of the people most affected by it. The result is a workforce that is both technically skilled and culturally grounded, able to operate drones safely and transform aerial data into actionable insights for leadership.

## ATS instructors combine technical skills with Indigenous knowledge

Every ATS training program begins with community engagement. Leadership, guardians, and elders are consulted to identify monitoring priorities and culturally sensitive areas. This ensures the program is not a one-size-fits-all package but instead tailored to the unique environmental and cultural context of each Nation.

From there, participants enter a structured training pathway. Classroom sessions introduce the fundamentals of drone operations, covering safety procedures, Transport Canada regulations, and mission planning. These sessions are interactive, encouraging participants to ask questions, share traditional knowledge, and relate drone use to local land-based practices.

The program then moves outdoors for hands-on flight practicums. Participants practice basic maneuvers, emergency procedures, and controlled flights before progressing to real monitoring missions. Flights are carried out over rivers, forests, and wetlands identified by the community as priority sites. Under instructor supervision, trainees capture high-resolution imagery, set up ground control points, and learn how to process data into usable maps and reports.

The training culminates in community-driven monitoring projects. These projects allow participants to apply their skills to real-world concerns, whether it is assessing post-wildfire regeneration, mapping shoreline erosion, or tracking water quality. Results are shared back with leadership, reinforcing the value of local capacity and giving communities a new, practical tool for decision-making.

## Field practicums give participants real-world experience in monitoring local environments

Drone monitoring works because it is repeatable, precise, and adaptable to local needs. ATS teaches participants to design flights that can be repeated season after season, ensuring consistent data for long-term comparisons. Missions are carefully planned with attention to altitude, camera settings, and image overlap so that results are both accurate and scientifically useful. These results allow the communities to make informed decisions about community projects, and decide on what would be best for them in the long-term based on the changes that they witness.

In forestry applications, drones capture detailed images of canopy health, storm damage, and regeneration after logging or wildfire. River systems are monitored through linear flight paths, allowing communities to assess erosion, sediment movement, and seasonal changes in water levels. Wetlands and cultural heritage sites are documented with high-resolution orthomosaics that can be layered into maps and shared in council meetings or planning sessions.

When needed, ATS introduces specialized sensors such as thermal cameras to detect seepage or hotspots, or multispectral cameras to measure vegetation health. These tools give communities deeper insights into ecosystem changes without the expense of hiring outside contractors.

Equally important is the data workflow. Participants are trained not just to fly, but to manage and interpret their results: importing imagery, running basic photogrammetry to produce stitched maps, validating quality, and highlighting key findings. The workflow is designed to be light enough for community computers while still producing professional-grade outputs.

The technical approach transforms each flight into evidence that leadership can use immediately, whether to guide conservation, negotiate with industry, or safeguard cultural knowledge.

## Drone data is processed into maps and reports that support evidence-based decision-making

For Indigenous communities, technology is only valuable when it strengthens sovereignty and aligns with cultural values. That principle guides every aspect of ATS training. Beyond flight skills and technical workflows, participants learn how to manage environmental data responsibly and in accordance with community-defined protocols.

**Data sovereignty** is central. All imagery and analysis generated during training belongs to the community and remains under their control. ATS emphasizes secure storage on locally managed drives or servers, clear versioning systems, and transparent permissions for who can access or share results. By keeping data ownership local, Nations protect sensitive knowledge, maintain control over how it is used, and ensure that monitoring efforts contribute directly to their own governance priorities.

Ethics in drone use also play a major role. Trainees are taught to respect privacy, avoid flights over residential areas without consent, and carefully consider the cultural significance of the sites they are monitoring. Elders often help guide these decisions, ensuring that drone missions do not intrude on sacred spaces or undermine traditional practices. This process builds trust within the community and ensures that drone technology supports — rather than disrupts — long-standing stewardship traditions.

ATS programs reinforce the idea that Indigenous Nations are not only keepers of the land but also keepers of the data. Each training cohort leaves with not just technical knowledge but also an ethical framework for responsible, respectful use of technology in service of the environment and their people.

## Data sovereignty ensures that environmental information remains under community control and guidance

Safety is the foundation of every ATS training program. Participants are introduced to Transport Canada regulations from the very first session and learn how to plan and conduct flights that meet national standards. This includes airspace awareness, weather assessment, pre-flight and post-flight checklists, and clear emergency procedures. By following a structured approach, communities can operate drones confidently without risking fines, accidents, or unnecessary hazards.

Practical drills are built into every stage of the training. Trainees rehearse what to do in the event of a lost signal, sudden weather change, or low battery emergency. They learn proper launch and landing protocols, safe distances from people and wildlife, and how to secure equipment during transport. These drills are not hypothetical; they are carried out repeatedly in the field until safety becomes second nature.

Compliance also means accountability. Every flight is documented with logs that track location, duration, and outcomes. Participants gain experience preparing reports and mission records, ensuring that operations remain transparent and defensible if reviewed by regulators. By combining this discipline with Transport Canada exam preparation, ATS ensures that graduates are not just certified pilots, but responsible operators capable of setting a high standard in their communities.

This approach builds trust among leadership, regulators, and the public. It demonstrates that Indigenous drone pilots are fully capable of conducting professional operations, meeting or exceeding the same standards expected of any commercial operator.

## Pre-flight checklists and emergency drills ensure that every mission is carried out safely and in compliance with regulations

The results of ATS drone training programs have been both measurable and transformative. Across more than 50 Indigenous communities, over 500 participants have received professional training and certification support. Together, they have conducted more than 1,000 drone flights, producing detailed monitoring data that covers large portions of Alberta and British Columbia. This scale of activity represents one of the most significant Indigenous-led environmental monitoring efforts in Canada.

The certification success rate is equally remarkable: **99%** of ATS students pass their Transport Canada examinations on the first attempt. This achievement reflects not only the high quality of instruction but also the determination of community members to gain skills that directly benefit their lands and livelihoods. Graduates leave with both technical confidence and internationally recognized credentials.

Beyond numbers, the impact is seen in everyday decisions. Communities now have access to timely aerial data that reduces delays and improves responsiveness to floods, forest changes, and environmental disturbances. This capacity has cut costs by decreasing reliance on chartered aircraft and external consultants, while simultaneously creating pathways to local employment in conservation, forestry, mining, and cultural heritage management.

Perhaps most importantly, communities report a renewed sense of sovereignty and pride. For the first time, many Nations can collect, analyze, and present their own environmental evidence without waiting for outsiders to interpret their land. Leaders describe how clear drone imagery strengthens negotiations, accelerates decision-making, and supports youth in seeing futures in science, technology, and stewardship.

## Drone-generated maps empower leadership with clear, timely evidence for decision-making

The success of drone training does not end when participants receive their certificates. For Indigenous communities, sustainability means embedding the technology into long-term stewardship practices and ensuring that future generations carry the skills forward. ATS supports this through youth mentorship programs and train-the-trainer pathways. Experienced graduates are encouraged to mentor new cohorts, visiting schools and youth programs to introduce drones as tools for both cultural knowledge and modern science. This approach creates a self-sustaining cycle of learning and builds pride as young people see their own community members leading advanced technology initiatives.

At the same time, communities are expanding into advanced applications that extend beyond the foundational program. Some have incorporated multispectral and thermal sensors to measure vegetation health, water temperature, and post-wildfire hotspots. Others are using drones to document cultural heritage sites, creating detailed maps and 3D models that preserve knowledge for future generations. Partnerships with conservation agencies and industry are opening new employment opportunities, where trained pilots provide specialized services in forestry, mining, and environmental assessment.

## Mentorship and youth training ensure skills are carried forward to future generations

ATS continues to walk alongside communities during this expansion, providing advanced workshops, refresher training, and technical support. The goal is to ensure that drone programs are not one-time projects, but long-term investments in sovereignty, environmental stewardship, and economic opportunity.

## Advanced sensors expand applications from basic mapping to vegetation health and thermal monitoring

Drone technology is transforming how Indigenous Nations safeguard their lands and waters. With the support of Aboriginal Training Services (ATS), communities are no longer waiting for outside reports or costly aerial surveys — they are flying their own missions, generating their own data, and making their own evidence-based decisions. This shift strengthens sovereignty, builds careers, and ensures that monitoring is rooted in the values of stewardship that have guided these territories for generations.

What began as training sessions has become something much larger: a movement where communities are keepers of the land, keepers of the data, and keepers of the environment. From youth mentorship in schools to advanced monitoring with thermal and multispectral sensors, Indigenous drone pilots are proving that modern aerospace tools and traditional knowledge belong together.

ATS is proud to stand alongside these Nations as they chart their own path forward. If your community is ready to explore drone training for environmental monitoring, or if you are seeking a partner to strengthen local stewardship capacity, we invite you to connect with us.
