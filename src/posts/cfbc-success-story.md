Across British Columbia, the **Construction Foundation of BC (CFBC)** invests in programs that turn potential into careers. In the **Sky Keepers** cohort, that mission met its mark: participants learned to fly, plan missions, and apply drone skills to real work—then carried those skills straight into industry.
<br><br> 

**Aboriginal Training Services** delivered the drone training component for Sky Keepers, blending classroom learning with hands-on flight practice and safety discipline. The result was more than certificates; it was confidence, professionalism, and a clear pathway into paid opportunities. One graduate, Tiffany, moved from program completion to a contract engagement supporting **H&K Agents** on imaging and mapping tasks for **AltaGas**—an early, concrete win that showcases what capability-building looks like when training is tied to real demands.
<br><br> 

Within the program, participants earned safety credentials alongside flight competencies, building a foundation for reliable field operations. With small, stable platforms and structured workflows, learners developed habits that translate into clean data and safe decision-making on job sites. CFBC’s role as catalyst, combined with Aboriginal Training Services’ practical training model, helped turn first flights into first wins.

The Sky Keepers cohort worked because every partner played a focused role. **CFBC** convened learners, removed barriers, and wrapped the training in essential workplace certifications. **Aboriginal Training Services** delivered the **Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS)** component—classroom foundations, safety discipline, and hands-on flight. **H&K Agents** provided the services connection and industry-facing expectations. And industry partners like **AltaGas** showed the destination: real job sites, real deliverables, and professional standards.
<br><br> 

From orientation onward, participants could see a straight line from learning outcomes to paid work. They practiced mission planning and communications the same way they would on a client site, from pre-flight briefings and risk checks to controlled recoveries and field notes that translate cleanly into reports.
<br><br>

<br><br> 

Learning accelerated because the cohort learned together. Participants compared notes, coached first flights, and kept one another accountable on checklists and voice prompts. As confidence grew, so did momentum—moving from cautious hovers to deliberate patterns, then to mapping profiles and documentation flights that leadership or clients can actually use.
<br><br> 

The visible takeaway is community: a group that not only completed formal training but also developed a rhythm—shared procedures, shared vocabulary, shared pride.
<br><br>

In class, participants built the mental model that makes field work calm and predictable. They learned aircraft systems, controller discipline, battery care, and the planning logic behind each mission. Navigation and airspace awareness were taught through scenarios: reading maps, interpreting constraints, and making conservative choices around people, structures, and weather.
<br><br> 

By the time they stepped outside, everyone understood the “why” behind each step—checklists, role assignments, and slow, deliberate inputs that keep teams safe and data clean.
<br><br>

<br><br> 

Before any props spun, the group rehearsed pre-flight routines and role calls: pilot in command, visual observer, and safety lead. They walked the site, checked wind and obstacles, set clear launch and recovery zones, and practiced call-and-response confirmations for each phase of flight.
<br><br> 

This discipline created calm. When launch time came, each person knew their part—and small issues were caught before they could become big ones.
<br><br>

<br><br> 

Outdoors, pilots moved from careful hovers to slow translations and stable orbits. Teams standardized briefings, hovered to verify sensors and orientation, and capped speeds near people and structures. Each sortie ended with a quiet, controlled recovery and an immediate debrief: what went well, what to adjust, and what to brief differently next time.
<br><br> 

These repetitions built muscle memory. By day’s end, the cohort could plan and fly short missions with a shared vocabulary and steady controllers.
<br><br>

<br><br> 

Training included winter conditions—low temperatures, changing light, and slick surfaces. Pilots learned to pre-warm batteries, shorten sorties, and keep conservative altitudes and speeds. Visual observers and the safety lead doubled down on communications, watching for bystanders and calling wind shifts or link warnings early.
<br><br> 

Cold-weather ops became another case study in discipline: dress for conditions, brief for shorter windows, and keep recoveries unhurried.
<br><br>

<br><br> 

Safety wasn’t a lecture; it was visible in every move. Teams staged cases and cones to keep prop arcs clear, marked launch pads, and maintained standoff distances around people and structures. Pilots verbalized intentions—“ascending to 30 metres,” “yaw right,” “returning to home”—so everyone could track the aircraft without confusion.
<br><br> 

Clear SOPs made sessions predictable, which made them safe—and made data quality much easier to achieve.
<br><br>

Learners practiced the kinds of shots that matter on industrial sites: establishing overviews, safe obliques of facilities, and steady orbits that document assets without disrupting operations. They reinforced conservative caps on speed and altitude, verified return-to-home points after repositioning, and captured footage that drops cleanly into briefings and reports.
<br><br> 

These habits—predictable patterns, smooth gimbal work, and meticulous logs—translate directly to professional environments.
<br><br>

The clearest sign a program works is when graduates get to work. Shortly after completion, **Tiffany** joined **H&K Agents** on imaging and mapping tasks for **AltaGas**, applying the very procedures she’d practiced in training—safety checks, role calls, steady patterns, and clean data hand-offs. Her story shows the pathway in full: CFBC’s wrap-around support, Aboriginal Training Services’ practical RPAS training, and industry-ready confidence that turns first flights into first contracts.
<br><br> 

Alongside flight skills, Sky Keepers participants earned essential workplace certifications—WHMIS, Food Safe, cultural connection programming, and more—making them safer, more versatile crew members on day one.
<br><br>

<br><br> 

Completion day recognized both skill and resilience. Graduates received certificates and community honours that reflected the deeper purpose of the program: creating dignified, future-proof opportunities while keeping safety, culture, and mutual support at the centre of the work.
<br><br> 

For many participants, the ceremony marked a turning point—confidence to pursue contracts, mentor others, and keep learning.
<br><br>

Instruction was collaborative. Aboriginal Training Services facilitators modeled safe habits, explained controller nuances, and tied every manoeuvre to an operational outcome. Questions flowed both ways—learners brought local knowledge, and instructors translated it into practical flight plans, data workflows, and clear deliverables for leadership or clients.
<br><br> 

The result is a cohort that doesn’t just fly—they brief, execute, document, and hand off data professionally.
<br><br>

Some sessions ran in local community spaces—a reminder that technology is most powerful when it’s rooted in place. The venue set a tone of respect and collaboration, where lived experience and local priorities shaped scenarios and flight plans.
<br><br> 

As the weeks progressed, learners took more ownership: leading briefings, assigning roles, and reviewing footage with a critical eye for what decision-makers need to see.
<br><br> 

By program’s end, crews flew with a calm, predictable style: deliberate climbs, stable orbits, clean recoveries. Observers called out drift, bystanders, or changing wind; pilots verbalized intentions; safety leads tracked timers and battery temps in cold weather.
<br><br> 

It’s a small thing that makes a big difference: predictable flying looks professional—and produces data leadership can trust.
