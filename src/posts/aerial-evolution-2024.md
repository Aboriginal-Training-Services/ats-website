Aerial Evolution’s annual Conference & Exhibition is where Canada’s RPAS community pressure-tests ideas: regulators outlining roadmaps, public-safety teams sharing lessons, and industry comparing data quality, safety, and cost.

For ATS, it’s also where we keep our curriculum aligned with what operators are actually doing—SORA-based risk thinking, practical Remote ID, emerging BVLOS frameworks, and heavy-lift logistics. Being in the room sharpened our focus on what students need in 2025: disciplined mission prep, stronger airspace literacy, and data workflows that stand up to audit.

## Indigenous Innovation Award

A highlight of the week was seeing ATS’s work in Indigenous aerospace training recognized with the **Indigenous Innovation Award** from the Aerial Evolution Association of Canada. The award celebrates programs that build capacity, career pathways, and community value—not just flight hours.

*Official certificate recognizing Indigenous Innovation in the RPAS sector.*

For us, that means co-designing training with Nations, tracking safety habits (not just passes), and ensuring graduates can deliver real projects: land stewardship, inspections, search support, and cultural documentation.

The citation speaks to sustained contributions: advancing the RPAS sector while championing Indigenous leadership and opportunity. We’re proud this recognizes the **how**, not only the **what**—building safety culture, standardizing checklists across community programs, and pairing youth pathways with professional upskilling for local staff.

## From pilot skill to repeatable safety systems

ATS contributed a session on upgrading from “pilot skill” to **repeatable safety systems**. We walked through:

- **Pre-flight discipline** using short, auditable checklists tied to SORA hazards.  
- **Crew resource management** for small teams (Pilot in Command, Visual Observer, Data Lead).  
- **Data integrity**: log what happened, not what was _supposed_ to happen.  
- **Human factors** in cold, heat, and fatigue—plus simple mitigations that stick.

The message landed: when communities build **systems** (not just skills), capability compounding begins.

## Panels & takeaways we’re folding into training

We sat in on public-safety and operations panels comparing workflows for emergencies, corridor flights, and complex sites. Key takeaways:

- **Operations intelligence**: short “ops huddles” beat long briefings.  
- **BVLOS readiness**: start with evidence—data links, detect-and-avoid behavior, and loss-link drills.  
- **UTM/Remote ID**: think benefit, not just compliance (deconfliction for multi-team events).  
- **Payload pragmatism**: pick sensors for the output product, not the spec sheet.

*Real-world workflows—BVLOS readiness, deconfliction/Remote ID, and lessons from multi-agency missions.*

## Connection & purpose

Conferences are also for connection. Alongside formal sessions, we joined a companion innovation gathering focused on technology and reconciliation—reminding us why this sector matters: safer communities, stronger stewardship, and dignified careers.

*Connecting with partners—how RPAS training creates real community outcomes and careers.*

## What this means for ATS students and partners

- **Curriculum updates**: more SORA-style risk thinking, stronger radio/airspace modules, and practical Remote ID.  
- **Assessment changes**: tighter evidence logs for safety behaviors and field-ready data-quality checks.  
- **Community focus**: continued co-development with Nations so training fits local projects and seasons.  
- **Career pathways**: clearer bridges from foundational flying to specialized roles (mapping, inspection, public safety).
