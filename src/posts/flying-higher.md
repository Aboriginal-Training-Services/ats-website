**How Aboriginal Training Services is helping NAIT students — including Indigenous learners — gain Transport Canada certification, hands-on drone experience, and skills that connect academic learning with real-world applications.**
<br><br>
Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) has long been recognized for its strong programs in applied sciences, engineering, and technology. But when it came to specialized training in **Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS)**, NAIT looked for a partner with proven expertise, real-world experience, and a culturally grounded approach. That partner was **Aboriginal Training Services (ATS)**.
<br><br>
The collaboration was designed to give NAIT students something beyond textbooks and lectures. ATS brought its **hands-on training model**, blending Transport Canada–compliant instruction with practical field missions and cultural awareness. This partnership ensured that students not only learned the theory of drone operations but also gained the confidence to fly, map, and interpret data in real-world contexts.
<br><br>
For NAIT, the partnership represented a chance to expand its academic offerings with industry-ready skills. For ATS, it was an opportunity to demonstrate how Indigenous-led training programs can thrive within a university setting — bridging traditional stewardship values with the demands of modern higher education.

<br><br>
Aboriginal Training Services (ATS) stands apart because it does more than deliver technical content — it **transforms how students engage with technology**. At NAIT, this meant bringing a teaching style designed for communities and adapting it seamlessly to a higher education environment.
<br><br>
ATS methods are built on three pillars. First, **Transport Canada compliance** ensures that every student is prepared to meet national licensing requirements, giving them credentials that are recognized across Canada. Second, **hands-on field training** moves learning beyond the classroom so students can plan missions, conduct flights, and produce usable outputs such as maps and models. Third, **cultural grounding** encourages students to see drones not only as technical tools but also as instruments of stewardship, responsibility, and connection to the land.
<br><br>
These methods proved to be a perfect complement to NAIT’s academic strengths. Where the university provided structure, research context, and resources, ATS brought in practical expertise, lived experience, and an approach that recognized the importance of sovereignty and cultural values.

<br><br>
A key strength of the NAIT–ATS partnership was the way it bridged **classroom learning with field application**. Students were not confined to theory; instead, they experienced the full cycle of professional RPAS operations.
<br><br>
In the classroom, ATS instructors guided students through regulations, airspace classifications, safety procedures, and mission planning. This built a solid foundation of knowledge and helped learners understand how Transport Canada rules apply in real scenarios.
<br><br>
Outdoors, those lessons came to life. Students launched drones in mapped flight grids, captured aerial imagery, and later processed that data into orthomosaics and 3D models. This combination of academic knowledge and applied skills gave learners a clear picture of how drones are used in environmental monitoring, engineering projects, and research.

While the NAIT–ATS partnership benefited all students, it held special significance for **Indigenous learners**. For many, drone training was more than an academic opportunity — it was a chance to connect higher education with their responsibilities as stewards of the land.
<br><br>
ATS’s training model recognizes that drones are not just technical devices, but **tools of sovereignty and stewardship**. In the university setting, this approach gave Indigenous students the confidence to see themselves not only as pilots and technicians but also as leaders carrying forward cultural values in a modern context.
<br><br>
By flying over rivers, forests, and cultural sites, students were able to visualize territory in new ways while grounding that work in the teachings of their communities. The program showed that advanced technology can be used in ways that respect protocols, stories, and traditional knowledge — rather than replacing them.

The partnership between ATS and NAIT was never just about flying drones — it was about giving students the skills to **apply drone technology in their studies, careers, and research**.
<br><br>
Environmental science students saw how drones could monitor wetlands, forests, and wildlife habitats. Engineering and construction students learned how aerial mapping supports surveying, inspection, and infrastructure planning. Learners in GIS and data analysis integrated drone imagery into mapping workflows, turning raw imagery into actionable information.
<br><br>
For Indigenous students, these skills extended beyond the campus. Many envisioned bringing drone mapping and monitoring back to their Nations to support guardianship programs, cultural site documentation, and community planning. The training showed them that they could build careers that serve both their professional goals and their responsibilities at home.

The impact of the NAIT–ATS training is best understood through the voices of the students who experienced it. Many described the program as transformative, not only for their education but for their sense of identity and future direction.
<br><br>
*“I had studied mapping and GIS in class before, but actually flying a drone and producing the data myself was a whole new experience. It connected everything we had learned and showed me how it applies outside the classroom.”* — **NAIT Student**
<br><br>
*“As an Indigenous student, this training meant a lot. It showed me that higher education can still reflect our responsibilities as stewards of the land. Flying over our territory and creating maps gave me pride in combining culture and technology.”* — **Indigenous NAIT Student**
<br><br>
*“The instructors from ATS made the material clear and practical. They gave us confidence to not only pass Transport Canada exams but to see ourselves as professionals ready to use drones in our careers.”* — **Graduate Participant**
<br><br>
These voices highlight the core purpose of the partnership: to build confidence, agency, and opportunity. Students left not only with deeper academic understanding, but also with **Transport Canada certifications, applied field experience, and a vision for how they can use drones to support their communities and careers**.

<br><br>
The collaboration between NAIT and Aboriginal Training Services shows what is possible when higher education partners with Indigenous-led expertise. By combining NAIT’s academic strengths with ATS’s hands-on, culturally grounded approach, students gained skills that went far beyond the classroom. They left prepared to contribute in research, industry, and community leadership — and, for Indigenous learners, to carry forward responsibilities as **keepers of the land, keepers of the data, and keepers of the environment**.
